# Installs the ChainTest-Katalon Bridge into a Katalon Studio project.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh /path/to/katalon/project [--force]
#
# --force also overwrites an existing
# Include/config/chaintest/chaintest.properties in the target project.
# Without it, a customized config is left alone.
#
# Safe to re-run for upgrades: library/keyword/jar files are always
# refreshed to the version shipped in this package.
